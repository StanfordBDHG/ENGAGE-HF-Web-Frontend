Web Frontend for the ENGAGE-HF project.

## Behavior

This repository provides dashboard to manage ENGAGE-HF application, for admins and clinicians. Clinicians can interact with patients, adjust their recommended medications, allergies and appointments.

## Stack

The ENGAGE-HF Web Frontend repository contains a React application built with TypeScript, Vite and Firebase. It provides automated GitHub Actions, setups for code linting, testing & test coverage reports, docker deployments, a docker compose setup.

## Getting started

This project uses Node.js v22. Install Node.js, e.g. using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating), [homebrew (for macOS)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node) or the official [Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download) .

### Backend

In order to use Web Frontend, you need to use actual Firebase environment or Emulator with seeded data. For developing locally, it's best to use the Emulator.

1. Clone `https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-Firebase` repository

2. In the root of ENGAGE-HF-Firebase run:

```bash
npm run prepare && npm run serve:seeded
```

Repeat step 2 each time files have changed.

Refer to [ENGAGE-HF-Firebase](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-Firebase) repository for more details.

### Dashboard

1. Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Setup environment variables

Refer [.env.example](.env.example) file for environment variables documentation. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust if necessary.

3. Start the Vite Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

## Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
2. Build the image and run the docker compose setup: `docker compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up`.

You can view the images you create with `docker images`.

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) with your browser to see the result. You can visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the reverse proxy setup before the main application.

The `docker-compose.yml` setup contains a production-ready setup using a reverse proxy.

Every version of the application on the `main` branch is automatically packaged into docker images using the `main` tag. Every release is also published using the `latest` and respective version tags.

## Deployment

This repository contains all necessary files to deploy the web frontend to Google Cloud Firebase.
